# Exploring correlations between different molecular descriptors: electron density (ED) and electrostatic potential (ESP) in H2O molecule


### ParaView

* Julien's analysis:

```
paraview --state=pvsm/H2O_ED_ESP/fiberSurfaceExploration.pvsm
```

  * data description:
    * *ed* - corresponds to the electron density of H2O molecule
    * *esp* - corresponds to the electrostatic potential of H2O molecule

  * typical analysis protocol in chemistry:
    * plot the *ed* isosurface for an isovalue 0.001 and color it by *esp*
