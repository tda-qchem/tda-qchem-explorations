# Exploring the transfer of relativistic effects in halogen-bonded complexes


# Pipeline description

This example applies the TDA tools for the bivariate analysis of the molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) and the electron density (ED) of selected halogen-bonded complexes. We are interested in the role of relativistic effects (in particular, the spin-orbit coupling) on the halogen bonds, e.g., on the mechanisms of transfer of relativistic effects from heavy to light atoms.

We selected a few systems:
  * from [this work](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/cp/d0cp05840h): AtCH2I...NH3, ICH2At...NH3
  * from [this work](paste-link): 
    * these are examples of donor-acceptor type complexes (frequent in bio-related research); here we reasses the use of MESP to study them
