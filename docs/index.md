# qchem-tda-explorations

This is a collection of examples accompanying the TDA-Qchem book (our scratch repository).

## Workflow

The detailed description of the workflow is [HERE-ADD LINK](link). 
There we describe how to reproduce the results and screenshots included in each chapter of the book.
