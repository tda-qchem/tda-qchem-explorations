# Description

This website collects examples of TDA applications to Quantum Chemistry. It is a scratch repository for generating examples discussed in the TDA-QCHEM book.

Each example includes:

* inputs and run scripts for a relevant quantum chemistry software
* a short description of outputs from quantum chemistry calculations
* screenshots from TTK
* a ParaView state file that allows reproducing the figures
* a short description of outputs and analysis in TTK
* a Python code that allows reproducing the full workflow
* links to quantum chemistry software and TTK documentation


# Prerequisites

These examples assume a default installation of DIRAC, TTK and QCTEN. 

# Full pipeline automatization
