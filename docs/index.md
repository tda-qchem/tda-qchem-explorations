# Description

This website collects examples of TDA applications to Quantum Chemistry. It is a scratch repository for generating examples discussed in the TDA-QCHEM book.

Each example includes:

* inputs and run scripts for a relevant quantum chemistry software
* a short description of outputs from quantum chemistry calculations
* screenshots from [TTK](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/)
* a ParaView state file that allows reproducing the figures
* a short description of outputs and analysis in [TTK](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/)
* a Python code that allows reproducing the full workflow
* links to quantum chemistry software and [TTK](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/) documentation

This website also contains:

* A list of molecular descriptors (with the notation and analytical formulas): [link](definitions.md)
* A short description of quantum chemistry and data models used in all calculations: [link](models.md)

How to cite this website: 

* Gosia - TODO: (1) mention it is a companion to our book, (2) add DOI


# Prerequisites

These examples assume a default installation of [DIRAC](http://www.diracprogram.org/), [TTK](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/) and [qcten](https://github.com/gosiao/qcten).
