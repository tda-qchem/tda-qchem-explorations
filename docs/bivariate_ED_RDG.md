# The joint analysis of the electron density and the reduced density gradient



# Chemical context

This example demonstrates the bivariate analysis of the electron density (ED) and the reduced density gradient (RDG) calculated for water dimer.
These two functions are often considered complementary descriptors of chemical information, with the ED well-suited to describe covalent bonds, and RDG for characterization of non-covalent interactions (NCIs).

Precisely, this analysis is done for the logarithms of these two fields (to facilitate handling large differences of ED values in different points in space due to the exponential decay of ED from the atomic center; it does not affect the results of the analysis).

The technical details of this analysis and its practical realization are also available [as the official TTK tutorial](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/examples/builtInExample2/)
