# Exploring $\sigma$-hole interactions through the topology of the molecular electrostatic potential and the electron density on benchmark data sets


# Pipeline description

This example applies the TDA tools for the bivariate analysis of the molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) and the electron density (ED) of subsystems of molecular systems selected from the [SH250x10 dataset](http://www.nciatlas.org/SH250.html).


Data is generated in the `DIRAC` software, the topological analysis is performed in the `TTK` software.


First, we start with the subset of 20 systems selected from this database, as suggested in [this paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/cp/d2cp01600a).
